# VBucks Generator Program

VBucks Generator is a Python script designed to simulate the generation of V-Bucks, the in-game currency used in the popular game *Fortnite*.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Run the program in your terminal by executing the following command:
   ```
   python vbucksgenerator.py
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen prompts to specify the amount of V-Bucks to generate and the recipient account.

3. If the specified amount exceeds the maximum limit of 1000 V-Bucks, the program will display a warning message indicating that the generation amount is too high.

4. If the user specifies the amount as 69.420, a special secret key will be revealed, invoking a hidden functionality within the program.

5. Upon successful input of a valid generation amount and recipient account, the program will display a confirmation message indicating the generation details.

## Caution

- **Uncommenting certain lines:** The program contains commented-out lines that, if uncommented, could have unintended consequences, such as deleting files. Exercise caution when uncommenting these lines.

## Disclaimer

This program is intended for entertainment purposes only and does not actually generate real V-Bucks. It is designed as a parody and should not be used for any illegal activities or fraud attempts. Use it responsibly and at your own risk. The developer assumes no liability for any misuse or damage resulting from the use of this program.
